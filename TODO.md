# TODO

This repo is forked from a third party implementation of Basel face fitting with PyTorch.
Although the code functions well, the project is not well written nor maintained.
Consider refactor the code to improve efficiency and code qualities.

- [ ] Upgrade PyTorch and PyTorch3D to newer version for better performance.
- [ ] Rename Python files to follow the naming convention.
- [ ] Remove the `gifs` folder.
- [ ] Fix the video fitting part.

Once every todo items were done, merge the code into our main repo, discard the submodule.
